# Personal Website for William Moore



### Run Locally
Run via docker (should update with most changes):

	make run
	
Recreate docker container to ensure all changes up:

    make refresh

Take down docker container

    make down

### Credits
- Theme: [pulse](https://bootswatch.com/pulse/)
- Forked from: [bootstrap-4-github-pages](https://github.com/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages)
- docker-compose based on: [docker-github-pages](https://github.com/Starefossen/docker-github-pages)

### Planning
Inspiration: [Adam O'Grady's personal website](https://adamogrady.id.au/)
What it has:
- social media links
- 'Personal' - a personal blog
- 2 blogs
- RSS

What I need:
- CV/History - maybe
- Links (personal accounts, linkedin and such)
  - Github link
- Writing
  - blog, probably not worth creating a new one just yet. Or if I want it, it doesn't have to be in this run
- Development projects (aka Github, not much more than a link though)
- Games
- Art (under links?)
- Need a page that is will2bill.com/games as that's on my CV and I don't want to break links ideally

Maybe:
- Home
- Development
- Creative Work
- History/About
- Shop may still be a good thing to have?


What I have currently:
- Home
  - listing out each of the sections with a bit about them
- Writing
  - Lists of individual pieces, hosting that work on the site itself.
- Games
  - List of games, with links to their github and their gameplay videos
- Art Gallery
  - Individual pieces, hosted on the site, displayed in kind of an awful format
- Store
  - Links to my two stores, Society6 and Deviantart
- About
  - A kind of shittier version of my CV
- Contact
  - Social links and embedded twitter. Plus my email
