# Contribution Guide

## Introduction

While this is a personal website, it is still an open source project and I welcome any bug reports or contributions from the community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing bug reports as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on the project's repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help me reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you used the website. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. It's always better to get more information. You can include links to files or GitHub projects, copy/pasteable snippets or even print screens or animated GIFS. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What's the name and version of the OS and browser you're using**?
* **Any other information that could be useful about your environment**
